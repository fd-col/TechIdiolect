# World Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW), or simply the Web, is a massive network of webpages, programs, and files that are accessible via URLs.

Powered by protocols, a web browser loads a webpage using various protocols:

- It uses the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol to convert a domain name into an IP address.
- It uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to request the webpage contents from that IP address.

- It may also use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to serve the website over a secure, encrypted connection.

The web browser uses these protocols on top of the Internet protocols, so every HTTP request also uses TCP and IP.
The Web is just one of the applications built on top of the Internet protocols, but it is by far the most popular.
