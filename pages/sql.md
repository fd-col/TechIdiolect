# SQL basics
SQL stands for the <b>structured query language</b>. It is pronounced as /ˈɛs kjuː ˈɛl/ or /ˈsiːkwəl/. 

It is a domain-specific language designed to manage data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

SQL consists of a data definition language, data manipulation language, and a data control language.

- The data definition language deals with the schema creation and modification e.g., CREATE TABLE statement allows you to create a new table in the database and the ALTER TABLE statement changes the structure of an existing table.
- The data manipulation language provides the constructs to query data such as the SELECT statement and to update the data such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
- The data control language consists of the statements that deal with the user authorization and security such as GRANT and REVOKE statements.
