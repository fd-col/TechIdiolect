## What is GitHub?
> GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git for versioning. 
<br> It is a popular place to _share_ and _contribute_ to **open-source software**. 

## What is a repository?
> A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository __tracks versions__ of files and folders.

## What is a branch?
> A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named **main** and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.
<br> Branches allow you to separate your work from the main branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.
